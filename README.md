# in-house-report

A full stack app for devs to share thier bugs with one another.
I build it to make an app that features CRUD, Auth and DB.

## It uses

- Vue
- Bootstrap 4
- Fontawesome
- Firebase

## It features
- Authentication
- Login / Logout
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

Any changes to the database are monitered by the app to update immediately.

To use the app it you need an email and password
You can see it running [here](https://fire-one-becf7.firebaseapp.com/)

They're are plenty of features I would like to add. I am currently working on ordering the the list by the time stamp and moving all the data into a vueX store.
